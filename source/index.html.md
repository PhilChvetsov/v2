# CoinFLEX Trade Engine APIs

CoinFLEX's application programming interfaces (APIs) provide our clients programmatic access to control aspects of their accounts and to place orders on CoinFLEX's trading platforms.

CoinFLEX provides several APIs:

* our native [WebSocket API][]
* a [RESTful API](REST.md)
* an [Event Stream resource](EventStream.md)
* a second futures [Event Stream resource](FUTURES.md#get-borrowerevents) for your collateral, leverage and margin

Using these interfaces it is possible to make both authenticated and unauthenticated API calls, with the exception of the Futures Event Stream which is authenticated only.

Access keys are available on the CoinFLEX logged-in dashboard page for verified users which, in conjunction with your account password, allow authenticated use these APIs.


## General notes

To protect the performance of the system, CoinFLEX imposes certain limits on the rates at which you may issue commands to the API. Please see [LIMITS.md](LIMITS.md).

All quantities and prices are transmitted and received as integers with implicit scale factors. For scale information, please see [SCALE.md](SCALE.md).

CoinFLEX has published [client libraries][] for several popular languages to aid you in implementing your client application.


## Getting started with the WebSocket API

**The [WebSocket API][] is accessible via [WebSocket][] connection to the following URLs:**


DEMO/STAGE site

`wss://stgapi.coinflex.com/v1   (encrypted)`

LIVE site

`wss://api.coinflex.com/v1      (encrypted)`

Commands, replies, and notifications traverse the WebSocket in text frames with [JSON][]-formatted payloads.

<aside class="success">
We strongly recommend that you use TLS transport for all connections.

# CoinFLEX Authentication Process

[WebSocket clients](#WEBSOCKET-README.md) authenticate by sending an authentication message containing a numeric user identifier, a cookie (described as an API key on the CoinFLEX website), a nonce chosen by the client, and an [ECDSA][] signature. The signature covers the user identifier, a nonce chosen by the server (which is transmitted to the client upon its connecting to the server), and the nonce chosen by the client. The connection is secured using TLS.

## Protocol

> **Example**

> Suppose a client whose user identifier is 1 and whose passphrase is "opensesame" wishes to authenticate to the WebSocket server.

> 1\. The client connects to the server and performs the WebSocket handshake.

> 2\. The server sends a `Welcome` notification and a randomly generated 16-bytes `server nonce`:

```json
{
    "notice": "Welcome",
    "nonce": "azRzAi5rm1ry/l0drnz1vw=="
}
```

> 3\. The client decodes the `server nonce` into these 16 bytes:

```yml
0x6b347302 2e6b9b5a f2fe5d1d ae7cf5bf
```

> N.B: Spaces are shown for the sake of clarity and do not denote elements of the actual value.

> 4\. The client randomly generates a 16-byte `client nonce`:

```yml
0xf08c98ca f1fd82e8 cea9825d bff04fd0
```

> 5\. The client encodes the `client nonce` using base64:

```yml
8IyYyvH9gujOqYJdv/BP0A==
```

> 6\. The client's `cookie` is:

```yml
HGREqcILTz8blHa/jsUTVTNBJlg=
```

> 7\. The client constructs a 40-byte `message` to sign, consisting of its `user_id`, the `server nonce`, and the `client nonce`:

```yml
0x00000000 00000001
0x6b347302 2e6b9b5a f2fe5d1d ae7cf5bf
0xf08c98ca f1fd82e8 cea9825d bff04fd0
```

> 8\. The client constructs a `seed` for its `private key`, consisting of its `user_id` and UTF-8-encoded passphrase:

```yml
0x00000000 00000001
0x6f70656e 73657361 6d65
```

> 9\. The client hashes its `seed` using SHA-224 to obtain its `private key`:

```yml
0xb89ea7fc d22cc059 c2673dc2 4ff40b97 83074646 86560d0a d7561b83
```

> 10\. The client [signs][ECDSA] the 28-byte SHA-224 digest of the 40-byte `message` using its `private key` under **secp224k1** and obtains, for example:

```yml
r = 0x3fb77a9d 7b5b2a68 209e76f6 872078c5 791340d5 989854ad a3ab735e
s = 0x34b84341 2f18a910 f18a7d4c e1d35978 60e6345b 22bf7894 cf67780a
```

> The [sign_secp224k1][] utility may be used to produce the `signature`.

> N.B: The `signature` (r, s) generated by the ECDSA is non-deterministic. Furthermore, the `signature` (r, s) is still non-deterministic if you use the deterministic `server nonce` and `client nonce` to build the codes, this is due to the nature of ECDSA.

> 11\. The client encodes the `signature` using base64:

```yml
P7d6nXtbKmggnnb2hyB4xXkTQNWYmFSto6tzXg==
NLhDQS8YqRDxin1M4dNZeGDmNFsiv3iUz2d4Cg==
```

> 12\. The client sends an `Authenticate` command to the server:

```json
{
    "method": "Authenticate",
    "user_id": 1,
    "cookie": "HGREqcILTz8blHa/jsUTVTNBJlg=",
    "nonce": "8IyYyvH9gujOqYJdv/BP0A==",
    "signature": [
        "P7d6nXtbKmggnnb2hyB4xXkTQNWYmFSto6tzXg==",
        "NLhDQS8YqRDxin1M4dNZeGDmNFsiv3iUz2d4Cg=="
    ]
}
```

> 13\. The server verifies the cookie and signature and returns a success response:

```json
{
    "error_code": 0
}
```

Authentication to the WebSocket server is by a `Welcome` notification sent to the client and an `Authenticate` command sent by the client.

* The `Welcome` notification contains a `nonce` field, whose value is a base64-encoded nonce that has been randomly generated by the server. The nonce is 16 bytes, and the base64 encoding transforms it into a 24-character string. This 16-byte nonce is hereafter referenced as the *server nonce*.
* The `Authenticate` command contains the following fields:
	* **`user_id`:** *(integer)* The unique numeric identifier of the authenticating user.
	* **`cookie`:** *(string)* A base64-encoded value that varies by user but is fixed for each specific user. In the CoinFLEX web interface, this authentication cookie is called an "API Key."
	* **`nonce`:** *(string)* A base64-encoded nonce that has been randomly generated by the client. The nonce is 16 bytes, and the base64 encoding transforms it into a 24-character string. This 16-byte nonce is hereafter referenced as the *client nonce*.
	* **`signature`:** *(pair of strings)* The base64-encoded *r* and *s* values of an [ECDSA][] signature over the SHA-224 digest of a message consisting of the concatenation of the 8-byte (big-endian) user identifier, the 16-byte server nonce, and the 16-byte client nonce. The signature uses the **secp224k1** curve parameters published by the [Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group][SECG] in [SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters version 2.0][SEC2] ([mirror][SEC2-mirror]). The private key used in signing is the 224-bit (big-endian) integer interpretation of the SHA-224 hash of the concatenation of the 8-byte (big-endian) user identifier and the UTF-8-encoded passphrase of the user.

# Event Stream

DEMO/STAGE site

* `https://stgwebapi.coinflex.com/event-stream`
    * Version 1

LIVE site

* `https://webapi.coinflex.com/event-stream`
    * Version 1

CoinFLEX offers an Event Stream resource that complies with the [Server-Sent Events] specification by the W3C. This resource delivers a continuous, consistent stream of events related to market and account activity on the CoinFLEX platform. It is offered as a simpler alternative to CoinFLEX's [WebSocket API] for clients that do not require bidirectional communication with the platform.

The Event Stream resource supports the standard `Last-Event-ID` request header to enable transiently disconnected clients to reconnect and resume the event stream without missing any events. See the [Server-Sent Events] specification for details.

## Authentication

**[[ Version 2:** The Event Stream resource may be requested without authentication, in which case only public events (order book and ticker changes) are returned. **]]**

Requests for the Event Stream resource **[[ Version 1:** must **]] [[ Version 2:** may **]]** authenticate using [HTTP Basic Authentication], wherein the *user-id* is the concatenation of user's numeric ID, a slash, and the user's Base64-encoded API key, and the *password* is the user's password or the Base64 encoding of the user's 28-byte private key that is derived from the user's ID and password. Authenticated requests will receive account-private events (balance changes and more details on the user's own order events) in addition to the public events.

## Common Record Types

### `<collateral>`

```json
{
    "asset_id": <integer>,
    "available": <integer>
    "total": <integer>
}
```

* **`asset_id`:** *(integer)* The numeric asset code of an asset in which the user's available collateral is reported.
* **`available`:** *(integer)* The [scaled][] amount of the user's available collateral in the identified asset.
* **`total`:** *(integer)* The [scaled][] amount of the user's equivalent account values in each asset that would remain if all of the user's outstanding loans were to be repaid (i.e. the users underlying collateral value measured in each asset).  The conceptual difference between this “total” figure and the “available” is that available collateral excludes funds needed for maintaining margin requirements, whereas total collateral represents a hypothetical scenario in which all loans are repaid and thus incurs no margin requirements.

### `<offer>`

* **`apr`:** *(integer)* The annualized interest rate of the offered loan, expressed with an implicit scale factor of 10000. For offers of futures contracts, this is always zero.
* **`qualifiers`:** *(array of strings, conditional)* The qualifiers that apply to this offer, if any.
	* **`promo`:** This is a promotional offer.
	* **`facility`:** This offer represents a loan facility that has been granted to the user.
