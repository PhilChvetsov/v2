# CoinFLEX Authentication Process

[WebSocket clients](#websocket-api-specification) authenticate by sending an authentication message containing a numeric user identifier, a cookie (described as an API key on the CoinFLEX website), a nonce chosen by the client, and an [ECDSA][] signature. The signature covers the user identifier, a nonce chosen by the server (which is transmitted to the client upon its connecting to the server), and the nonce chosen by the client. The connection is secured using TLS.

## Protocol

> **Example**

> Suppose a client whose user identifier is 1 and whose passphrase is "opensesame" wishes to authenticate to the WebSocket server.

> 1\. The client connects to the server and performs the WebSocket handshake.

> 2\. The server sends a `Welcome` notification and a randomly generated 16-bytes `server nonce`:

```json
{
    "notice": "Welcome",
    "nonce": "azRzAi5rm1ry/l0drnz1vw=="
}
```

> 3\. The client decodes the `server nonce` into these 16 bytes:

```yml
0x6b347302 2e6b9b5a f2fe5d1d ae7cf5bf
```

> N.B: Spaces are shown for the sake of clarity and do not denote elements of the actual value.

> 4\. The client randomly generates a 16-byte `client nonce`:

```yml
0xf08c98ca f1fd82e8 cea9825d bff04fd0
```

> 5\. The client encodes the `client nonce` using base64:

```yml
8IyYyvH9gujOqYJdv/BP0A==
```

> 6\. The client's `cookie` is:

```yml
HGREqcILTz8blHa/jsUTVTNBJlg=
```

> 7\. The client constructs a 40-byte `message` to sign, consisting of its `user_id`, the `server nonce`, and the `client nonce`:

```yml
0x00000000 00000001
0x6b347302 2e6b9b5a f2fe5d1d ae7cf5bf
0xf08c98ca f1fd82e8 cea9825d bff04fd0
```

> 8\. The client constructs a `seed` for its `private key`, consisting of its `user_id` and UTF-8-encoded passphrase:

```yml
0x00000000 00000001
0x6f70656e 73657361 6d65
```

> 9\. The client hashes its `seed` using SHA-224 to obtain its `private key`:

```yml
0xb89ea7fc d22cc059 c2673dc2 4ff40b97 83074646 86560d0a d7561b83
```

> 10\. The client [signs][ECDSA] the 28-byte SHA-224 digest of the 40-byte `message` using its `private key` under **secp224k1** and obtains, for example:

```yml
r = 0x3fb77a9d 7b5b2a68 209e76f6 872078c5 791340d5 989854ad a3ab735e
s = 0x34b84341 2f18a910 f18a7d4c e1d35978 60e6345b 22bf7894 cf67780a
```

> The [sign_secp224k1][] utility may be used to produce the `signature`.

> N.B: The `signature` (r, s) generated by the ECDSA is non-deterministic. Furthermore, the `signature` (r, s) is still non-deterministic if you use the deterministic `server nonce` and `client nonce` to build the codes, this is due to the nature of ECDSA.

> 11\. The client encodes the `signature` using base64:

```yml
P7d6nXtbKmggnnb2hyB4xXkTQNWYmFSto6tzXg==
NLhDQS8YqRDxin1M4dNZeGDmNFsiv3iUz2d4Cg==
```

> 12\. The client sends an `Authenticate` command to the server:

```json
{
    "method": "Authenticate",
    "user_id": 1,
    "cookie": "HGREqcILTz8blHa/jsUTVTNBJlg=",
    "nonce": "8IyYyvH9gujOqYJdv/BP0A==",
    "signature": [
        "P7d6nXtbKmggnnb2hyB4xXkTQNWYmFSto6tzXg==",
        "NLhDQS8YqRDxin1M4dNZeGDmNFsiv3iUz2d4Cg=="
    ]
}
```

> 13\. The server verifies the cookie and signature and returns a success response:

```json
{
    "error_code": 0
}
```

Authentication to the WebSocket server is by a `Welcome` notification sent to the client and an `Authenticate` command sent by the client.

* The `Welcome` notification contains a `nonce` field, whose value is a base64-encoded nonce that has been randomly generated by the server. The nonce is 16 bytes, and the base64 encoding transforms it into a 24-character string. This 16-byte nonce is hereafter referenced as the *server nonce*.
* The `Authenticate` command contains the following fields:
	* **`user_id`:** *(integer)* The unique numeric identifier of the authenticating user.
	* **`cookie`:** *(string)* A base64-encoded value that varies by user but is fixed for each specific user. In the CoinFLEX web interface, this authentication cookie is called an "API Key."
	* **`nonce`:** *(string)* A base64-encoded nonce that has been randomly generated by the client. The nonce is 16 bytes, and the base64 encoding transforms it into a 24-character string. This 16-byte nonce is hereafter referenced as the *client nonce*.
	* **`signature`:** *(pair of strings)* The base64-encoded *r* and *s* values of an [ECDSA][] signature over the SHA-224 digest of a message consisting of the concatenation of the 8-byte (big-endian) user identifier, the 16-byte server nonce, and the 16-byte client nonce. The signature uses the **secp224k1** curve parameters published by the [Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group][SECG] in [SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters version 2.0][SEC2] ([mirror][SEC2-mirror]). The private key used in signing is the 224-bit (big-endian) integer interpretation of the SHA-224 hash of the concatenation of the 8-byte (big-endian) user identifier and the UTF-8-encoded passphrase of the user.
